# Showcases 

I got inspired from the video I saw on youtube "10 JavaScript Projects in 10 Hours - Coding Challenge". I did not watch how he does the project but it came to me that everytime a client asks me to show my code I can direct them to public show cases I do.

## Languages/Frameworks

I will use different languages/frameworks so you can peek whichever  relevant to your project is.

Initially I have following ones and see where they lead me to

* JavaScript
* Ruby & Ruby on Rails
* VueJS

You will find a Readme.md in each folder describing the projects.
